ReverbRoom is a plugin audio that I developed as my thesis project. Itâ€™s based on physical models and simulates a reverb.


This software has been developed by Gabriele Granelli at the Laboratorio di Informatica Musicale (LIM) of the University of Milan. It was born as a project related to the thesis "VST per la riverberazione dato disegno della stanza" of the Bachelor's Degree in Computer Music Science.
